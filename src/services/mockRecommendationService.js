    priority: 'HIGH',
    priorityColor: 'red',
    shortText: 'Maintain adequate soil moisture. Provide light irrigation during flowering.',
    fullExplanation: 'During panicle elongation and full bloom, avoid heavy flood irrigation as it triggers vegetative flush instead of floral retention. Give light drip irrigation at 3-4 day intervals to sustain floral turgor.',
    actionRequired: 'Run drip lines for 90 minutes every 3rd day in morning hours (06:00 AM - 08:00 AM).',
    timing: 'Immediate — Next 48 Hours',
    icon: 'Droplet',
    badge: 'HIGH PRIORITY',
    organicAlternative: 'Mulch tree basin with dried grass/paddy straw (8-10 cm thickness) to conserve rhizosphere moisture.'

    priority: 'MEDIUM',
    priorityColor: 'amber',
    shortText: 'Monitor for hoppers and thrips. Use recommended biological or chemical control.',
    fullExplanation: 'Early nymphs suck sap from tender panicles, turning them brown and dry (causing severe flower drop). Sample 5 panicles per tree in inner shaded canopy for hopper count.',
    actionRequired: 'If hopper count > 3/panicle, spray Azadirachtin (Neem oil 10,000 ppm) @ 2 ml/L or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 0.3 g/L.',
    timing: 'Inspect within 2 days; Spray in late evening',

    title: 'Pollination & Honeybee Protection',
    priority: 'MEDIUM',
    priorityColor: 'amber',
    shortText: 'Encourage pollinators. Avoid excessive pesticide sprays during flowering.',
    fullExplanation: 'Over 85% of mango fruit set depends on insect vectors (Diptera & Apis honeybees). Heavy broad-spectrum spraying during peak bloom drastically cuts fruit set.',
    actionRequired: 'Refrain from spraying during peak bee foraging hours (08:30 AM to 12:30 PM). Place 2-3 bee boxes per acre if available.',
    timing: 'Throughout active bloom window (Next 12 days)',

    badge: 'MEDIUM PRIORITY',
    organicAlternative: 'Spray 1% jaggery water on perimeter trees to attract beneficial dipteran flies and pollinators.'

    shortText: 'Apply balanced nutrients to support flower retention and fruit set.',
    fullExplanation: 'Boron and Zinc are critical co-factors for pollen tube germination and ovule fertilization. Deficiency causes blackened tips and flower shedding.',
    actionRequired: 'Foliar spray of Solubor (Boron 20%) @ 1.25 g/L + Cheated Zinc @ 1.0 g/L at 50% panicle emergence.',
    timing: 'Within 5–7 days before flower opening',

    shortText: 'Monitor upcoming rainfall and temperature changes during flowering.',
    fullExplanation: 'Forecast indicates intermittent showers on 27 Aug & 01 Sep. High relative humidity combined with warm temperatures creates peak conditions for Oidium mangiferae (Powdery mildew).',
    actionRequired: 'Apply protective spray of Wettable Sulphur 80% WP @ 2.5 g/L before the 27 Aug rain window.',
